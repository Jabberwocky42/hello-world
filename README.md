Repository for CS250 Module 4

Although I've been programming off and on for over 30 years, I have never seriously pursued it as a career.  Instead, I got an associates degree in electronics, and became and Electronics Technician.  Over the last 10 years, more and more of my work has involved programming, mostly Python, and C.  I am taking Computer Science classes to increase my chances of landing an Engineering position as a software developer.
